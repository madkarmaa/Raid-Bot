Just a bad made Discord bot for raids, built in [**discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## ⚠️ Requirements

Running the bot requires certain libraries that **must** be installed.

### Windows OS installation

1. Download and install [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/download/)
2. Download and run [**install.bat**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/27fwhfi847khcas/install.bat?dl=1). It will automatically download the bot and install the libraries. Windows Defender will most probably flag the file as dangerous. Just click "**More details > Run anyway**"

A Discord bot token is also required. Head over to the [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create an application.

## 📌 Prefix

The prefix is "**>**", but you can also mention the bot itself.

## 📝 Commands

### **ping**

( _Example: >ping_ )

Check the bot's latency.

### **nuke [ _your Discord ID_ ]**

( _Example: >nuke 123456789_ )

Deletes all roles and channels, changes the server name, and creates random channels where it mentions **@everyone**.

Your Discord ID, that you also got asked for when running the script, is used by the bot to make sure that other users can't interact with it.

### **nukestop**

( _Example: >nukestop_ )

Stops the nuke command.

## 🛑 Disclamier

I am not responsible of any damage caused to any Discord server/user. Raiding violates the [**Discord ToS**](https://discord.com/terms) and can result in an account ban. Thanks for your attention.
