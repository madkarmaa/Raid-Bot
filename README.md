Just a bad made Discord bot for raids, built in [**discord.py**](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## ⚠️ Requirements

Running the bot requires certain libraries that **must** be installed.

### Windows OS installation

1. Download and install [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/download/)
2. Download and run "[**install.bat**](https://github.com/madkarmaa/Raid-Bot/releases/latest)". It will automatically download the bot and install the libraries. Windows Defender will most probably flag the file as dangerous. Just click "**More details > Run anyway**"

For future bot usages, always run "**install.bat**".

## 🚨 IMPORTANT

No file must be moved outside or inside the "**Raid-Bot**" folder, as "**install.bat**" will always check for it in its same directory. If you really need to move those files, make sure that "**Raid-Bot**" and "**install.bat**" are in the same directory.

A Discord bot token is also required. Head over to the [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create an application. The bot requires **Administrator permissions** on the server to work properly.

## 📌 Prefix

The prefix is "**>**", but you can also mention the bot itself.

## 📝 Commands

### **ping**

( _Example: >ping_ )

Checks the bot's latency.

### **nuke [ _your Discord ID_ ]**

( _Example: >nuke 123456789_ )

Deletes all roles and channels, changes the server name, and creates random channels where it mentions **@everyone**.

Your [**Discord ID**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-), that you also got asked for when running the script, is used by the bot to make sure that other users can't interact with it.

### **nukestop**

( _Example: >nukestop_ )

Stops the nuke command.

## 🛑 Disclamier

I am not responsible of any damage caused to any Discord server/user. Raiding violates the [**Discord ToS**](https://discord.com/terms) and can result in an account ban. Thanks for your attention.
